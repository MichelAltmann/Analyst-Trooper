This is the startup screen of the app, including two tabs, the Characters and the Species tab.

The first one to appear is the characters one.

After clicking it, you'll go back to the list of species.

To go to other screens, you just need to click on the icons on the bottom.

<h3>Search Screen</h3>
The search screen is the biggest one, it has 5 tabs to work with:
<li>Characters</li>
<li>Species</li>
<li>Starships</li>
<li>Vehicles</li>
<li>Planets</li>
You can cycle between each tab, just by clicking, or dragging the screen to the left or right, the tabs can also scroll horizontally.

On each tab you have the option to see the details, just like the others, but you can also use the search bar on top to filter exactly the name of what you want, for example you can search for "Skywalker" in the characters tab, and you'll see all the characters with skywalker in it's name.
